# react-docker
Hey Faye, Once you pull the repo.
First you wil need to install docker in your machine.
-then just have it running 
-Open FinLit repo with your favorite IDE
-Open Terminal in your ide at FinLit Root Level
-First command you will run is "docker-compsose build"
(You will see whole bunch of warnings ignore it if it finishes)
-Second you will run "docker-compose up"
this should let you know that React app is being served in port 3000
-api is node-mongo container backend
-client is react app front end
